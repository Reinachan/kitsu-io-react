It features a lot of visual storytelling with only minimal exposition that doesn't come off as obtrusive to me, but rather making sure that all kids understand what's going on. Most of it is conveyed through visuals and only some of it through dialogue and visuals on top. This is cool! I love how there's a long story with Pichu and the pok√©mon that lets him stay with them! And this kinda also explains to us why Pikachu didn't quite like Ash at first. \n\nVisually it's like Sun & Moon mostly. The backgrounds are very simple and not pretty at all. Honestly, they look kinda ugly ... However, as a result, there's also a lot more backgrounds and a ton more animation! Like, this episode has much more animation than I can remember any episode in Sun & Moon having. I'm impressed by how much there is! And it's not just that there's a lot, it's also high quality and expressive!\n\nI don't like Ash's voice actor that much, nor do I like professor Oak's much either. I don't necessarily think they're bad or anything, just that I don't like them that much. Kana Hanazawa is doing a stellar job so far though. I love her as Koharu!\n\nIn general, I'm definitely looking forward to more of this, and if this is the quality it's going to be at, it's gonna be one fantastic ride!",

But yea, pokemon has always had lackluster backgrounds, so I get your point there. This has the potential to be a great new gen.",
